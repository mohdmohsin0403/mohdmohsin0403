Heya, Myself Mohd Mohsin Khan persuing B.Tech in CSE specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Solving problems creatively is what I do. I am an AI ML enthusiast, looking around for things. 

I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects. I am an intermediate coder in python, C++ and Java. Knows the basic of R language and currently trying my hands in NodeJS. I have done some basic python projects in my school life and I have tried my hands on Advanced python projects to in my college life using some of the most populous libraries used - Tkinter, pandas, NumPy, and many more. 

Being an engineering student I like to write. I never knew that I could write, but I wasnâ€™t even sure how to go about it. My first encounter with writing was when I was in class 11th and caught red-handed by my teacher and when I joined college, I started trying for content writing internships. Now, I am a published writer, with my book published "Who am I?" and I am a part of at least 20 anthologies. Currently, I am compiling an anthology too, with almost 50-60 co-authors.
