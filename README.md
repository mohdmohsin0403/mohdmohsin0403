### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm Mohd Mohsin Khan, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I believe in applying classical strategies to modern-day projects, and I'm an intermediate-level programmer in Python, C++, and Java. Recently, I've been trying my hand at NodeJS and am excited to expand my knowledge in this area.

I've completed some basic and advanced Python projects using popular libraries like Tkinter, Pandas, and NumPy, and I'm always looking for new challenges to enhance my programming skills. Writing is another passion of mine that I discovered in high school, and I'm now a published author with my book "Who am I?" and have contributed to at least 20 anthologies. Currently, I'm working on compiling an anthology with almost 50-60 co-authors.

I'm thrilled to be on this journey of learning and self-discovery, and I believe that my passion for AI and ML, programming skills, and writing talent make for an excellent combination. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to this world.
